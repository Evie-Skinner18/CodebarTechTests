// There are two players - X and O.
// The game is played on a 3 x 3 grid.
// Players alternate to place Xs and Os on the grid until either wins.
// A player can only place their piece in an empty square.
// A player's turn is over once they have placed their piece.
// The first player to get 3 of their pieces in a row (up, down, across or diagonally) wins.
// When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 pieces in a row, the game ends in a tie.
