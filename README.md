# Demystifying Tech Tests
My preparation for coaching at the Codebar workshop, and continuous improvement post-workshop.

# _C#_
## Fizz Buzz
* I found the C# implementation of this easy.
* One blocker I had was understanding the subtle difference between how an 'if' and how an 'else if' works in C#. I fixed a bug that I have encountered before on a previous attempt at this challenge: the problem of the function printing either a 'fizz' or a 'buzz' for multiples of 3 and 5 instead of 'fizzbuzz'.
* To improve my solution, I would like to find a way of writing the function that does not heavily rely on conditional statements (if possible).

## Bank
* I was pleased with how quickly I managed to come up with an initial idea for how the solution would work.
* I am very pleased with the OOP nature of my code
* I would like to improve this by adding a feature that takes in bank account data from a CSV file.

## Supermarket
* I found this harder to make than the Bank application, but not too hard.
* I found it easy to conceptualise the key objects in the supermarket situation as objects in code
* I enjoyed making this more than the other solutions, because I liked the modular way this situation works in real life (and therfore how it can easily be expressed in OO code). One can approach the checkout with a trolley of different items and apply different offers each time, because there is a separate object for Product and a separate method for each special offer.
* I think it would be better if I had a Scan() method, so it's possible to scan each item one at a time: currently, the hwole shopping trolley goes in as an argument when a checkout object is instantiated.


# _JavaScript_
## Fizz Buzz
* I found this challenge harder in JavaScript, but not too hard.
* I enjoyed learning about Node and how I could apply it to the challenge
* I am blocked trying to make the app into an interactive command line programme that uses Node to take user input.

## Noughts and Crosses
* This challenge was harder than Fizz Buzz, but not unsurmountably hard.
* I enjoyed taking some logic that I had used a year ago to create DATE NIGHT, and improving it whilst tweaking it to fit the purposes of this test.
* I enjoyed overcoming this challenge, because a year ago I remember attempting this at Sparta and struggling a great deal
* I found it easy to make the game visually pleasing and interactive for the user
* The hardest part was writing a function to check for a winner
* I would like to learn how to make my code here object orientated, as it looks completely different to my solutions to the other tests.
* There is a bug with the checkForWinner() function that I have highlighted in an Issue.
