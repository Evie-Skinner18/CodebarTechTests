# Demystifying Tech Tests
My preparation for coaching at the Codebar workshop, and continuous improvement post-workshop.

# _C#_
## Fizz Buzz
* I found the C# implementation of this easy.
* One blocker I had was understanding the subtle difference between how an 'if' and how an 'else if' works in C#. I fixed a bug that I have encountered before on a previous attempt at this challenge: the problem of the function printing either a 'fizz' or a 'buzz' for multiples of 3 and 5 instead of 'fizzbuzz'.
* To improve my solution, I would like to find a way of writing the function that does not heavily rely on conditional statements (if possible).

## Bank
* I was pleased with how quickly I managed to come up with an initial idea for how the solution would work.
* I am very pleased with the OOP nature of my code
* I would like to improve this by adding a feature that takes in bank account data from a CSV file.
